This program calculates the optimal flight path based on time or cost using a given dataset of flights between cities.  This calculation is performed through the use of a backtracking algorithm.

Also created and utilized a custom stack class called DSStack, a custom doubly linked list class called DSLinkList, and a custom adjacency list class called AdjacencyList.
